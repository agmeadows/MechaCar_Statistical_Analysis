## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

A multiple linear regression was run against the data set. All six categories were evaluated (vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, AWD). The results were as follows:

The R-squared value is 0.715 and the P-value is smaller than than the assumed significance of 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

The primary contributing categories are ground clearance and vehicle length. The linear model does predict MPG effictively as the correlations are statistically significant. Additional categories may provide more accurate results.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The suspension coil data set was analyzed to show:

    - The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots
    - The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

The results are:
#### Statistics Across All Lots

#### Statistics Per Lot

In total, the variance is withing the manufacturing limit of a 100 PSI variance. However, per lot variance is not acceptable. Lot 3 is out of specification and should be rejected.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

T-Tests were run across all lots and for each lot to determine if the PSI values are statistically different from the population.

Here are the results:

#### T-Test for all lots - from a sample of 50
![Stats Across Lots](/images/ttest_all.PNG)

The P-Value is above 0.05 and the mean is 1499.02. The PSI values are not statistically different

#### T-Test for Lot1
![Stats Across Lots](/images/ttest_lot1.PNG)

The P-Value is lower than 0.05 and the mean is 1500. The PSI values are statistically different.

#### T-Test for Lot1
![Stats Across Lots](/images/ttest_lot2.PNG)

Similar to lot 1, the P-Value is lower than 0.05 and the mean is 1500.02. The PSI values are statistically different.

#### T-Test for Lot3

Here the P-Value is above 0.05 and the mean is 1496.14. The PSI values are statistically different.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

It would be beneficial to study and quantify how MechaCar holds up against the competition. This can be done by analyzing the following metrics:

    - Initial cost of vehicle
    - fuel economy
    - safety rating
    - cost of ownership
    - reliability

The metrics to test with the type of test would be:

    - Two-Sample t-Test of vehicle cost vs the competition based on vehicle class
    - Two-Sample t-Test Fuel economy vs the competition base on vehicle class
    - ANOVA test of safety rating vs competition
    - Linear regression test of vehicle cost of owenership vs age
    - Linear regression test of reliability vs vehicle age

The alternate hypothesis is that the MechaCar vehicles are statistically superior to the competition. The tests outlined above shoulddefinitively prove, beyond random chance, that the vehicles are superior. 

The required data would be as follows:

    - Vehicle name
    - Vehicle class
    - Initial purchase cost
    - Engine type
    - MPG
    - Age of vehicle
    - Cost of repairs
    - Number of problems reported
    - NHSTA safety rating
